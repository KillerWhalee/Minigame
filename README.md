Minigame
Developed by `CHAEMIN LIM`

## Introduction

Minigame is developed for fun, making several card games to play in break time.

## How to use Minigame?

For card game, it may not that straightforward.

### One Card

Basically we use four keys : "W" "A" "D" "X".

As you can see from its location on keyboard, "W" is for select, "A", "D" is for move to left/right, "X" is for draw.

### Omok

There's no tip for playing Omok. You can just click where you want your stone to put.

The last stone put is labeled with colored triangle so that player can know where the stone is.

\* Omok is for 2-player. Computer AI is not implemented, unfortunately.

## Future goals

For each game, when I get enough learning of AI and deep learning, I want to make computer to learn how to play these minigames well.
